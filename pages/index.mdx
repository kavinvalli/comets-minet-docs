# Comets

The biggest problems with metaverses is siloed metaverses created by
disconnected teams. That is where Comets comes in. It allows you to carry over
progress from one metaverse to another and in the process connects metaverses
together.

## Example Use Case

Think of it like a game. An Online Multiplayer Game. Say, you put in a lot of
effort in one game and get some assets. Now, that game loses its popularity. You
move to another similar game where you have to start from scratch. But, if both
the games use the Comets API, this can be avoided. Now, a game is just an
example. Similarly in a more 'metaversy' language, if you buy land in one
metaverse, it will not carry on to the next. But if both metaverses have Comets
api plugged in, it will be very easy to sync the process.

## How Comets works

Comets is very easy to use for developers. It provides an API which is very easy
to plug in with minimal changes to your codebase.
